        <div class="row">
          <p>Based on my previous research, I created two user personas - Ashley, who is more of a casual user and just wants to use the app to de-stress, and Brooke, who is interested in having the full-on experience of getting all the
            recommendations for her mental health program and experts in those fields.</p>
          <p>I always kept these two personas and their interests in mind while creating my prototypes later on.</p>

            through several iterations of my app.
            Having the possibility to test these versions with people improving the functionality as well as the visualization of the app, I was able to come up with a solution based on user research.</p>

            users wanted to read more, I presented what the app can do in a more visually pleasing way. Furthermore, after the peer review I introduced more white space on the screen to make it more easily readable and less text heavy.</p>

          <p>During this process, I’ve learnt that it is important rather than wanting to have a perfect screen or prototype from the beginning to keep a user-centric approach and to test faster with potential users, so that I can be confident that my work is something potential users want. I’ve also enjoyed interacting with my peers to get new ideas and impulses.</p>
