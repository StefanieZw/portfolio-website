          <p>We all need the advice of an expert sometimes, and how-to videos don’t always cut it. Focusing on mental health, the app takes on a holistic approach in the area of mental health and provides a way to reach out for experts in these
            fields – be it exercise, food, meditation or psychological help.</p>

            recommendations for her mental health program and experts in those fields.</p>

            through several iterations of my app.
            Having the possibility to test these versions with people improving the functionality as well as the visualization of the app, I was able to come up with a solution based on user research.</p>

          <p>In a first round, I tested my mid-fidelity prototype with 6 participants. Overall, the participants found the app easy to use and logically structured. However, analyzing the data, there were some issues that consistently appeared with
            all or most of the participants.

            users wanted to read more, I presented what the app can do in a more visually pleasing way. Furthermore, after the peer review I introduced more white space on the screen to make it more easily readable and less text heavy.</p>
